            <h1>Mateja's Guides</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my collection of guides. As a self motivated learner, I come across a number of problems, especially when it comes to computer software. After researching across the internet in search for answers, I begin to understand the problem and various approaches towards a solution. After becoming more comfortable with the situation, I like to write a guide on how I would go about solving it.</p>
            <p>There are three main reasons I choose to do this. One, I like to keep a future reference for myself in case I need to remind myself of a step that's missing from my memory. Two, It's easier to commit things to memory when you write them down, especially when you write it in a format that's welcoming to new readers. And finally, I hope that these guides can serve as a helping hand to others who might find themselves in a similar situation as me, and I hope they can take at least a fraction of what I write and use it to help themselves solve their own problems.</p>
