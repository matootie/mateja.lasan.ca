**This project has been abandoned in favour of a more modern approach**

I'm now focusing on building my website as a set of microservices distributed across a Kubernetes cluster. Django is amazing for many and most use cases, however as I'm looking to expand my knowledge in the field of web development, it no longer fits my needs.

## Section 1: Introduction.

Welcome to my personal and professional website, featuring a portfolio of
projects, a resume of skills and experience, as well as lots of other
media created and or curated by myself.

## Section 2: Sections.

My website comprises of several different "apps," of which I'm going to
call sections. Each section serves a different purpose. Below I've listed
all the sections of my website, with a description of their purpose as
well as some challenges or lessons I came across along the process of
development.
